# Hasselblad Measurement Conclusions

*[한국어](measurements.md)*

Back to the [main README](../README.md).

As of v12/day-night v3 (see `brands/hasselblad.py`'s docstring).

- **Pixel-level 5-part signature analysis (2026-07, all 124 official samples, genuine originals)**:
  saved to `datasets/hasselblad/{tone,color,texture,gamut}_signature.json` +
  `joint_distribution.npz`. Computed tone/saturation-hue/sharpening-noise-halo/Lab a·b gamut
  pixel-by-pixel against genuine originals (no resize/re-encoding).
  - **Confirmed empirically that you must NOT just pool all pixels and take percentiles**:
    the 124 photos range from 300K to 200M pixels, a 676x spread, so pixel-pooling lets a few
    large photos dominate the statistics (pooled b2 collapses to 1.0, vs. 18.1 for the
    per-photo-equal-weight average - more than a 10x difference). The population target must
    be computed as a "per-photo equal-weight average" - the pooled histogram itself is still
    kept in `joint_distribution.npz`, but it isn't used as the target.
  - **Cross-checked the cache (`downloaded_samples/`, resize + re-encoded) against the genuine
    originals 1:1 for all 124 photos**: over the 94 shadow-valid (dark_pct>5%) photos, black-point
    p2 was 11.27 (cache) vs 10.63 (original) - a 0.6 / 5.7% difference. White-point p99.5 was
    223.85 (cache) vs 225.56 (original) - a 1.7 / 0.8% difference. Both are noise-level
    differences, **confirming the cache did not distort the tone-curve correction target
    (b2/w995)** - the existing target (11.3/223.9) that v9/`apply_hncs` is based on remains valid.
    (Note: during this re-verification, a file-index mapping mistake initially produced a false
    conclusion that "cache vs. original differ by 60%" - this was caught and corrected by
    re-cross-referencing all 124 photos 1:1; the numbers above are the corrected ones.)
  - **Conclusion: no changes needed to `apply_hncs`/day-night parameters.** The tone target was
    already accurate, and saturation/hue/texture/gamut (the color/texture/gamut signatures) are
    channels HNCS was never designed to touch in the first place, so they aren't a "target" -
    they're stored purely as reference data recording what the population actually looks like.
- **Pipeline signature analysis (2026-07, re-downloaded all 124 official samples as genuine
  originals)**: bypassed `downloaded_samples/` (the project's own cache, which distorts noise
  metrics via resize + re-encoding) and freshly `curl`'d all 124 unprocessed originals
  (`/tmp/true_originals/`, 4.5GB) to measure sharpening strength/micro-contrast/noise/edge halo/
  JPEG compression characteristics. The download URL list had 18 overlaps with an earlier
  5-photo pilot sample, which were removed (105 unique). Note, though: the `orig_*.jpg` set
  (124 photos, 1:1 with CSV rows) that was actually used for the population statistics and the
  day/night v3 correction has no internal duplicates at all - the existing recalibration results
  are unaffected.
  - JPEG quality: 77% (81/105) are Q99 · YCbCr 4:4:4 (effectively lossless), with a minority
    (17 photos, filenames suggesting early X1D-series bodies) at Q75 · 4:2:0. The brand filter
    itself doesn't re-encode to JPEG, so this figure is reference metadata only.
  - Sharpening energy (mean absolute high-frequency value, median 2.65) and micro-contrast
    (DoG std, median 6.37) are strongly correlated (r=0.77) - a signal of a consistent local-
    contrast processing style. However, since these values are self-referential statistics
    between finished JPEGs rather than a paired comparison against an unprocessed original,
    there's no baseline to quantify how much stronger they are than a neutral render → judged
    insufficient grounds to add a new sharpening parameter to the curve module, deferred.
  - Edge halo (overshoot): the median is essentially flat across quality tiers (7-8%, Q<=80 /
    81-95 / >95 all similar) - the "lower quality → bigger halo" pattern seen in the 5-photo
    pilot disappears once the sample grows (the mean spikes because of a few extreme outliers,
    irrelevant on a median basis). Correlation with sharpening energy is also weak (r=0.24).
    Outliers (orig_133 at 129.9%, orig_68 at 45.6%, etc.) appear to be genuine specular-highlight
    edges misdetected as halo - reconfirming the existing caveat that this metric can't
    distinguish JPEG ringing / genuine halo / a scene's own bright reflections.
    → halo-based parameters also deferred
  - Noise: per-file variance is extreme (0.001-6.6) and the per-subsampling-group means overlap
    heavily (4:2:0 0.34 / 4:4:4 1.19 / 4:2:2 0.32, n=7-81), so it isn't explained by chroma
    subsampling or JPEG quality - reconfirming the existing conclusion that it's scene-content-
    dependent (ISO, light level, texture). No grounds for a new brand-wide fixed grain/denoise
    parameter.
  - **Conclusion**: even scaling the sample up to the full 124 photos, none of
    sharpening/halo/noise produced a signal clean and confident enough to say "encode this value
    as a new parameter in the code." Per the project's existing overfitting-avoidance principle,
    decided not to change `brands/hasselblad.py` - the real output of this analysis is the
    evidence-backed conclusion that "not changing anything is correct."
- **Re-verification (2026-07, after the brands/core/tools refactor)**: re-ran `apply_hncs`
  (parametric) and `apply_hncs_learned` (learned) through `tools.calibrate grid_search`/
  `learn_curve` and confirmed the RMSE reproduces exactly as before the refactor
  (23.31→16.51 for grid_search, 23.31→15.41 for learn_curve) - there are still only 10 raw+jpeg
  pairs (the rest are dead links), so there's no new data to recalibrate against
- **day/night v3**: built a contact sheet from all 124 official samples and reviewed each one by
  eye, picking out 12 unambiguous night scenes (streetlights/neon/aurora/Milky Way/city night
  views, etc.) and reclassifying the remaining 112 as day (v2 had only 5 day + 4 night samples).
  New targets: day black-p2=11.5/white-p99.5=224.1 (n=112), night black-p2=9.7/white-p99.5=221.3
  (n=12) - a much larger sample than v2, and it converges (even more so) toward the overall
  population target (11.3/223.9). `apply_hasselblad_day` was refit against the new target
  (midtone_gamma 0.95→0.85, contrast_n 1.15→1.35, white_point 0.96→0.92, RMSE 22.01→18.65);
  `apply_hasselblad_night`'s grid search landed back on the existing defaults as optimal, no
  change. The case for keeping day/night as separate presets keeps weakening (not yet merged)

- Over the full pool of 124 official samples: black-p2=11.3, white-p99.5=223.9; the portrait
  subset (43 photos) is 10.2/226.3 - no major shift from v8 (19-20 photos)
- Automated verification on the 43 portrait photos found skin-tone hue is essentially unchanged
  before/after `apply_hncs` (mean |delta|=0.21, max 2.0, on a hue scale of 0-179)
- Grid-searching against genuine raw→JPEG before/after pairs (10 photos) revealed the curve had
  no global exposure/gamma correction step (`exposure_gamma`), so it couldn't close the
  brightness gap between the pre/post-grading images (v10) → added an `exposure_gamma`
  parameter, excluded an extreme high-key sample (an indoor Oculus shot with no shadows) from
  the black-point fit, and re-searched (v11)
- Final adoption (`apply_hncs`, v11): applied `white_point=1.0`, `exposure_gamma=0.7`, kept
  `toe_lift`/`shoulder_start` at their original values (0.001/0.78) - RMSE improved from 36.3 to
  23.3. Lowering the shoulder start point to 0.5 drops RMSE further to 16.5, but with only 8
  shadow-valid samples, changing the curve's shape itself was judged an overfitting risk and
  deferred
- Tried switching the raw-rendering baseline to a linear gamma (1,1), which seemed more
  "accurate" on paper, but RMSE actually got worse (23.3→28.2) - rawpy's own demosaic/color-
  matrix algorithm differs from Hasselblad's actual pipeline, so getting "closer to the sensor"
  didn't help (a negative result, reverted)
- `apply_hncs_learned` (v12): without assuming a toe/shoulder shape, learned the
  neutral_L→target_L mapping directly from raw+jpeg pairs at the pixel level (10.78 million
  pairs) - RMSE 15.4, better than the parametric version's 23.3. The sample-size constraint
  (still only 10 raw+jpeg pairs) remains the same, and the hue error introduced by the round-
  trip through 8-bit conversion is slightly larger than `apply_hncs`'s (mean |delta|~3.0/179,
  still visually negligible)
- Tried regularizing the learned LUT toward the parametric curve out of concern for the small
  sample, but a 10-fold leave-one-out cross-validation showed the pure unregularized empirical
  LUT performs best (LOO RMSE 14.6, getting worse - 20.7→28.0 - as regularization strength
  increases) - because there are enough pixel samples per bin that variance isn't the problem;
  the parametric curve's own shape bias is the bigger source of error. `apply_hncs_learned` is
  kept without regularization
- **Another expansion attempt (2026-07) - all negative results.** Investigated whether any
  usable source exists beyond the 124 photos.
  - Directly parsed `hasselblad.com/learn/sample-images/`'s X/H/V system gallery pages down to
    the Storyblok CMS `page-data.json` and cross-checked against the existing 124 photos
    (139 CSV rows) - zero new files. The official source is already saturated.
  - Hasselblad's official Instagram posts (verified 8 user-supplied screenshots) - EXIF is
    entirely stripped by platform re-encoding, and one of the posts turned out to be
    sponsored/edited content - unusable.
  - explorecams.com (500px-sourced) X1D gallery, all 51 listed photos (1 detail page 404'd,
    50 checked) - full EXIF verification: 44% Lightroom/Photoshop-edited, 36% completely
    stripped EXIF, 14% Instagram re-encoded, and only 6% (3 photos) looked like genuine SOOC -
    and all 3 of those were from the same photographer (Raymond Cheung). Too small and too
    non-diverse a subset to add to the population - excluded.
  - imaging-resource.com's X2D 100C review gallery (the same source already used for the other
    4 population-fit brands) - all 45 non-edited candidates came back corrupted on
    imaging-resource.com's own CDN ("Premature end of JPEG file", reproduced byte-for-byte via
    both curl and urllib) - zero survivors. See "Image trustworthiness policy" in
    `docs/methodology.en.md` for details.
  - dpreview.com's sample galleries (`/samples/album/hasselblad-*`) - the galleries themselves
    exist, but the site is behind a Cloudflare bot challenge (`cf-mitigated: challenge`,
    confirmed to be dpreview.com's own origin response, not a proxy policy block), so automated
    scraping isn't possible - excluded without attempting to bypass it.
  - **Conclusion**: there is no known path to grow the sample beyond 124 photos right now.
    `apply_hncs`/`apply_hncs_learned`/day-night parameters remain unchanged.
